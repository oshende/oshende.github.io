## About Me

I am a postdoctoral research associate at [<span style="color:blue">Los Alamos National Laboratory</span>](https://www.lanl.gov)) as of early 2025. I received my Ph.D. from the department of Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University in December 2024. I graduated in 2018 with a B.S.E. in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Princeton University and an M.S. in mechanical engineering from Stanford University in 2020. My current projects revolve around quantifying the interactions between turbulence and reacting scalar fields in complex flows, as well as the role of multiphysics on momentum and scalar transport more generally in reduced-order systems. Outside of the lab, I enjoy cooking, reading, hiking, and racquet sports. 


## Research Overview

During my Ph.D., I was part of the <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/~alimani">Mani Group</a>. My <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LCY03RAAAAAJ&hl=en">primary focus</a> was on modeling the interactions between reacting flows and turbulent transport. This provides insight into fields as disparate as atmospheric pollution, battery electrochemistry, or air-breathing propulsion. I am also interested in high-perfomance computing, big data, multiphase transport, and other aspects of high Reynolds number flows and aerodynamics. I am grateful to have been supported by the Stanford Graduate Fellowships in Science and Engineering and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships. I have also benefitted from collaborations with the <a href="https://sd.llnl.gov">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>.

I have done some work on modal analyses of <a href="transition.pdf">transition to turbulence on a flat plate boundary layer</a> and sub-grid scale modelling for large eddy simulations, including for <a href="homogenous.pdf">homogenous variable density turbulence</a>.
