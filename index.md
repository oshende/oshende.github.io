## About me

I am a postdoctoral research associate at the [<span style="color:azure;">Los Alamos National Laboratory</span>](https://www.lanl.gov) working at the LANL SPARC with the [<span style="color:gold;">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</span>](https://umich.edu). I received my Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at Stanford University in December 2024. I have a B.S.E. in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Princeton University and an M.S. in mechanical engineering from Stanford University. My current projects in XCP-4 division revolve around quantifying the interactions between turbulence and reacting scalar fields in complex flows, as well as the role of multiphysics on momentum and scalar transport more generally in reduced-order systems. 

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, reading, hiking, and racquet sports. I like outreach and helped run the [<span style="color:crimson;">Stanford SeeMe</span>](https://seeme.stanford.edu) program.

## My work
During my Ph.D., I was part of the [<span style="color:crimson">Mani Group</span>](https://www.stanford.edu/~alimani). My primary focus was on modeling interactions between reacting flows and turbulent transport to provide insight into fields as disparate as atmospheric pollution, battery electrochemistry, or air-breathing propulsion. I benefitted from collaborations with the [<span style="color:azure">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</span>](https://sd.llnl.gov).


I am generally interested in high-perfomance computing, big data, multiphase transport, and other aspects of high Reynolds number flows and aerodynamics. I have done some work on modal analyses of [<span style="color:blue">transition to turbulence on a flat plate boundary layer</span>](./assets/docs/transition.pdf) and sub-grid scale modelling for large eddy simulations, including for [<span style="color:blue">homogenous variable-density turbulence</span>](./assets/docs/homogenous.pdf).
