# Me

I am a postdoctoral research associate at the [<span style="color:blue">Los Alamos National Laboratory</span>](https://www.lanl.gov) as of early 2025 as part of the LANL SPARC at the [<span style="color:gold;">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</span>](https://umich.edu). I received my Ph.D. from the department of Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University in December 2024. I graduated in 2018 with a B.S.E. in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Princeton University and an M.S. in mechanical engineering from Stanford University in 2020. My current projects revolve around quantifying the interactions between turbulence and reacting scalar fields in complex flows, as well as the role of multiphysics on momentum and scalar transport more generally in reduced-order systems. Outside of the lab, I enjoy cooking, reading, hiking, and racquet sports. 


# Research

During my Ph.D., I was part of the [<span style="color:blue">Mani Group</span>](https://www.stanford.edu/~alimani). My primary focus was on modeling the interactions between reacting flows and turbulent transport. This provides insight into fields as disparate as atmospheric pollution, battery electrochemistry, or air-breathing propulsion. I am also interested in high-perfomance computing, big data, multiphase transport, and other aspects of high Reynolds number flows and aerodynamics. I am grateful to have been supported by the Stanford Graduate Fellowships in Science and Engineering and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships. I have also benefitted from collaborations with the [<span style="color:blue">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</span>](https://sd.llnl.gov).

I have done some work on modal analyses of [<span style="color:blue">transition to turbulence on a flat plate boundary layer</span>](./assets/docs/transition.pdf) and sub-grid scale modelling for large eddy simulations, including for [<span style="color:blue">homogenous variable-density turbulence</span>](./assets/docs/homogenous.pdf).

At Stanford, I was also a part of [<span style="color:crimson;">Stanford SeeMe</span>](https://seeme.stanford.edu), an outreach program affiliated with the Department of Mechanical Engineering.
